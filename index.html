        <h1>Sass & Scss</h1>
        <p>
            SASS has a loose syntax that uses no semicolons and has a lot of white space. SCSS is more expressive and syntax-oriented. SCSS is more like CSS, and therefore, semicolons and brackets are required. Supports SassDoc for adding documentation.

            Keyword Arguments
            When a mixin is included, arguments can be passed by name in addition to passing them by their position in the argument list. This is especially useful for mixins with multiple optional arguments, or with boolean arguments whose meanings arenâ€™t obvious without a name to go with them. Keyword arguments use the same syntax as variable declarations and optional arguments.
