    <h1>Difference between Sass & Scss</h1>
    <p>
        SASS has a loose syntax that uses no semicolons and has a lot of white space. SCSS is more expressive and syntax-oriented. SCSS is more like CSS, and therefore, semicolons and brackets are required. Supports SassDoc for adding documentation.
